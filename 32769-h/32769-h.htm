<h1>THE LAST GENERATION</h1>

<h2><a name="INTRO" id="INTRO"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>I had been awake for I know not how
many hours that summer dawn while the
sun came over the hills and coloured the
beautiful roses in my mother's garden. As
I lay drowsily gazing through the window,
I thought I had never known a morning
so sultry, and yet so pleasant. Outside not
a leaf stirred; yet the air was fresh, and
the madrigal notes of the birds came to me
with a peculiar intensity and clearness. I
listened intently to the curious sound of
trilling, which drew nearer and nearer, until
it seemed to merge into a whirring noise
that filled the room and crowded at my
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 10]</span>
ears. At first I could see nothing, and lay
in deadly fear of the unknown; but soon I
thought I saw rims and sparks of spectral
fire floating through the pane. Then I
heard some one say, "I am the Wind."
But the voice was so like that of an old
friend whom one sees again after many
years that my terror departed, and I asked
simply why the Wind had come.</p>

<p>"I have come to you," he replied,
"because you are the first man I have discovered
who is after my own heart. You
whom others call dreamy and capricious,
volatile and headstrong, you whom some
accuse of weakness, others of unscrupulous
abuse of power, you I know to be a true
son of Æolus, a fit inhabitant for those
caves of boisterous song."</p>

<p>"Are you the North Wind or the East
Wind?" said I. "Or do you blow from
the Atlantic? Yet if those be your feathers
that shine upon the pane like yellow and
purple threads, and if it be through your
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 11]</span>
influence that the garden is so hot to-day,
I should say you were the lazy South
Wind, blowing from the countries that I
love."</p>

<p>"I blow from no quarter of the Earth,"
replied the voice. "I am not in the compass.
I am a little unknown Wind, and I
cross not Space but Time. If you will come
with me I will take you not over countries
but over centuries, not directly, but waywardly,
and you may travel where you
will. You shall see Napoleon, Cæsar,
Pericles, if you command. You may be
anywhere in the world at any period. I
will show you some of my friends, the
poets...."</p>

<p>"And may I drink red wine with Praxiteles,
or with Catullus beside his lake?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, if you know enough Latin
and Greek, and can pronounce them intelligently."</p>

<p>"And may I live with Thais or Rhodope,
or some wild Assyrian queen?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 12]</span>
"Unless they are otherwise employed,
certainly."</p>

<p>"Ah, Wind of Time," I continued with a
sigh, "we men of this age are rotten with
booklore, and with a yearning for the past.
And wherever I asked to go among those
ancient days, I should soon get dissatisfied,
and weary your bright wings. I will be no
pillar of salt, a sterile portent in a sterile
desert. Carry me forward, Wind of Time.
What is there going to be?"</p>

<p>The Wind put his hand over my eyes.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPI" id="CHAPI"></a>I</h3>

<h2>AT BIRMINGHAM TOWN HALL</h2>


<p>"This is our first stopping place," said a
voice from the points of flame.</p>

<p>I opened my eyes expecting to see one
of those extravagant scenes that imaginative
novelists love to depict. I was prepared
to find the upper air busy with
aeroplanes and the earth beneath given
over to unbridled debauch. Instead, I discovered
myself seated on a tall electric
standard, watching a crowd assembled before
what I took to be Birmingham Town
Hall. I was disappointed in this so tame
a sight, until it flashed across me that I
had never seen an English crowd preserve
such an orderly and quiet demeanour; and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 14]</span>
a more careful inspection assured me that
although no man wore a uniform, every
man carried a rifle. They were obviously
waiting for some one to come and address
them from the balcony of the Town Hall,
which was festooned with red flags. As
the curtains were pulled aside I caught a
momentary glimpse of an old person whose
face I shall never forget, but apparently it
was not for him that the breathless crowd
was waiting. The man who finally appeared
on the balcony was an individual not more
than thirty years old, with a black beard
and green eyes. At the sound of acclamation
which greeted him he burst out into
a loud laugh; then with a sudden seriousness
he held up his hand and began to
address his followers:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have but few words for you, my
army, a few bitter words. Need I encourage
men to fight who have staked
their existence to gain mastery? We cannot
draw back; never will the cries of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 15]</span>
the slaughtered thousands we yearned to
rescue from a more protracted, more
cruel misery than war, make us forget the
myriads who still await the supreme mercy
of our revenge.</p>

<p>"For centuries and for centuries we endured
the march of that Civilisation which
now, by the weapons of her own making,
we have set forth to destroy. We, men of
Birmingham, dwellers in this hideous town
unvisited by sun or moon, long endured to
be told that we were in the van of progress,
leading Humanity year by year along
her glorious path. And, looking around
them, the wise men saw the progress of
civilisation, and what was it? What did
it mean? Less country, fewer savages,
deeper miseries, more millionaires, and
more museums. So to-day we march on
London.</p>

<p>"Let us commemorate, my friends, at
this last hour, a great if all unwitting benefactor,
the protomartyr of our cause. You
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 16]</span>
remember that lank follower of the Newest
Art, who lectured to us once within these
very walls? He it was who first expounded
to us the beauty of Birmingham, the artistic
majesty of tall chimneys, the sombre glory
of furnaces, the deep mystery of smoke,
the sad picturesqueness of scrap-heaps
and of slag. Then we began to hate our
lives in earnest; then we arose and struck.
Even now I shudder when I think of
that lecturer's fate, and with a feeling
of respect I commemorate his words
to-day.</p>

<p>"On, then! You need not doubt of my
victory, nor of my power. Some of you
will die, but you know that death is rest.
You do not need to fear the sombre fireworks
of a mediæval Hell, nor yet the
dreary dissipations of a Methodist Heaven.
Come, friends, and march on London!"</p>

<p>They heard him in deep silence; there
was a gentle stir of preparation; they faded
far below me.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPII" id="CHAPII"></a>II</h3>

<h2>THE PROCLAMATION</h2>


<p>At a point ten years farther along that
dusky road the Wind set me down in a
prodigious room. I had never before seen
so large and splendid a construction, so
gracefully embellished, so justly proportioned.
The shape was elliptical, and it
seemed as if the architect had drawn his
inspiration from the Coliseum at Rome.
This Hall, however, was much larger, and
had the additional distinction of a roof,
which, supported by a granite column,
was only rendered visible from beneath by
means of great bosses of clear gold. Galleries
ran round the walls, and there was
even a corkscrew balustrade winding up
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 18]</span>
round the central pillar. Every part of the
building was crowded with people. There
seemed to be no window in the place, so
that I could not tell whether or no it was
night. The whole assembly was illuminated
by a thousand electric discs, and the
ventilation was almost perfectly planned
on a system to me entirely strange. There
was a raised throne at one end of the
building on which sat a King decently
dressed in black. I recognised the green-eyed
man, and learnt that his name was
Harris, Joshua Harris. The entire body
of the Hall was filled by soldiers in mud-coloured
tunics and waterproof boots.
These were the men that had conquered
the world.</p>

<p>As soon as the populace were well
assembled the King made a sign to his
Herald, who blew so sudden and terrific
a blast with his trumpet that the multitude
stopped their chattering with a start.
The Herald proceeded to bawl a proclamation
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 19]</span>
through his megaphone. I heard
him distinctly, but should never have been
able to reproduce his exact words had not
the Wind very kindly handed to me one
of the printed copies for free distribution
which it had wafted from a chair. The
proclamation ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"I, Joshua Harris, by right of conquest
and in virtue of my intelligence,
King of Britain, Emperor of the two
Americas, and Lord High Suzerain of
the World, to the Princes, Presidents,
and Peoples of the said world&mdash;,
Ye know that in days past an old
man now dead showed me how man's
dolorous and fruitless sojourn on this
globe might cease by his own act and
wisdom; how pain and death and the
black Power that made us might be
frustrated of their accustomed prey.
Then I swore an oath to fulfil that
old man's scheme, and I gathered my
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 20]</span>
followers, who were the miserable men,
and the hungry men, and we have conquered
all there is to conquer by our
cannon and by our skill. Already last
year I gave public notice, in the proclamation
of Vienna, in the proclamation
of Cairo, in the proclamation of
Pekin, and in the proclamation of Rio
Janeiro, that all bearing of children must
cease, and that all women should be
permanently sterilised according to the
prescription of Doctor Smith. Therefore
to-day, since there is no remote
African plain, no island far away in the
deep South Seas where our forces are not
supreme and our agents not vigilant, I
make my final proclamation to you, my
army, and to you, Princes, Presidents,
and Peoples of this world, that from
this hour forth there be no child born
of any woman, or, if born, that it be
slain with its father and its mother (<i>a
fainting woman had here to be carried out</i>),
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 21]</span>
and to you, my terrestrial forces, I entrust
the execution of my commands.</p>

<p>"Joy then be with you, my people,
for the granaries are full of corn and
wine that I have laid up, sufficient for
many years to come; joy be with you,
since you are the last and noblest generation
of mankind, and since Doctor
Smith by his invention, and I by my
wise prevision, have enabled you to live
not only without payment and without
work (<i>loud cheers from the galleries</i>),
but also with luxury and splendour, and
with all the delights, and none of the
dangers, of universal love."</p>
</div>

<p>I expected the proclamation to be followed
by an outburst of applause; but
instead the whole multitude sat calm and
motionless. Looking round I was struck
by the hideous appearance of mankind.
It was especially revolting to look at the
ears of the soldiers in front, who had their
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 22]</span>
backs turned to me. These stuck out from
the bullet-like heads, and made the men
look like two-handled teapots on stands.
Yet here and there appeared in the galleries
some woman's countenance beautified
by the sorrows of our race, or some
tall youth whose eyes expressed the darkest
determination. The silence seemed to
gather in folds. I was studying drowsily
the Asiatic dresses and the nude people
from Melanesia, when I heard a noise
which I thought was that of the Wind.
But I saw it was the King, who had begun
to laugh. It was a very strange noise
indeed, and very strange laughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPIII" id="CHAPIII"></a>III</h3>

<h2>THE MUTUAL EXTERMINATION CLUB</h2>


<p>"You would perhaps like to stay here
some time," said the Wind, "and look
around. You will then understand the
significance of this generation more clearly,
and you may observe some interesting
incidents."</p>

<p>I was standing with one or two other
people outside a pseudo-Chinese erection,
which I at first took to be a cricket
pavilion, and then saw to be the headquarters
of a rifle club. I apprehended
from the placards that I was in Germany,
and inquired in the language of the
country, which I understand very well,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 24]</span>
what was the object of this rifle practice,
and whether there was any thought of
war.</p>

<p>The man to whom I addressed myself,
an adipose person with iron-rimmed spectacles
and a kindly, intelligent face, seemed
surprised at my question.</p>

<p>"You must be a stranger," he said.
"This is our very notable <i>Vertilgungsverein</i>."</p>

<p>I understood: it was a Club for Mutual
Extermination.</p>

<p>I then noticed that there were no ordinary
targets, and that the cadets were pointing
their rifles at a bearded man who stood
with a covered pipe in his mouth, leaning
against a tree some two hundred yards
away.</p>

<p>After the report the bearded man held
up both hands.</p>

<p>"That is to signify that he has been
completely missed," said the fat gentleman.
"One hand, wounded; two hands,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 25]</span>
missed. And that is reasonable (<i>vernünftig</i>),
because if he were dead he could not raise
either."</p>

<p>I approved the admirable logic of the
rule, and supposed that the man would
now be allowed to go free.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, according to the rules," he
answered, "he certainly is allowed to go
free; but I do not think his sense of
honour would permit him so to do."</p>

<p>"Is he then of very noble family?" I
inquired.</p>

<p>"Not at all; he is a scientist. We have
a great many scientists in our club. They
are all so disappointed at the way in which
human progress has been impeded, and at
the impossibility of a continuous evolution
of knowledge-accumulation, that they find
no more attraction in life. And he is dead
this time," he continued, shading his eyes
to look, as soon as a second report had
flashed.</p>

<p>"By the way," I asked, "I suppose you
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 26]</span>
only exterminate&mdash;er&mdash;members of the
club?"</p>

<p>The fellow smiled with a little disdain.
"Oh, it would be illegal for us to exterminate
outsiders. But of course if you would
like to join...."</p>

<p>"Why, that's never a woman going over
to the tree!" I cried.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, we have quite a number of
intellectual women and upper-class ladies
of advanced ideas in the club. But I do
not think that lady is an intellectual; she
is more probably a passion-wreck."</p>

<p>She was indeed a very handsome woman
in the prime of life, dressed with a little
too much ostentation and coquetry in a
sleeveless, transparent white blouse and a
skirt to match.</p>

<p>My informant turned round to a skinny
young student with hog's-bristle hair, and
made some vulgar jest about its "being a
pity to waste such a good piece of flesh."
He was a superman, and imagined, falsely
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 27]</span>
I believe, that an air of bluff cynicism, a
Teutonic attempt at heartiness, was the true
outward sign of inward superiority. The
young man fired, and the woman raised
the arm that was not shattered by the
bullet. He fired again, and she fell on her
knees, this time with a scream.</p>

<p>"I think you had better have a shot,"
said the sharpshooter to my man. "I'm
rather bad at this."</p>

<p>Indeed his hand was shaking violently.</p>

<p>My interlocutor bowed, and went over
to take the rifle. The skinny student took
his place by my side, and began talking
to me as well. "He's an infallible shot
that Müller there," he said, nodding at my
former companion.... "Didn't I tell
you?"</p>

<p>To my great relief the passion-wrecked
lady fell dead. I was getting wildly excited,
rent between horror and curiosity.</p>

<p>"You see that man in the plumed hat?"
said the student. "He is coming round
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 28]</span>
to say on whom the lot has fallen. Ah,
he is coming this way, and making a sign
at me. Good-day, sir," he said, taking off
his hat with a deep and jerky bow. "I am
afraid we must continue our conversation
another time."</p>

<h2>THE EPISODE OF THE BABY</h2>


<p>As soon as I turned away, rather horrified,
from the merry proceedings of the Mutual
Extermination Club, I seemed to be in
England, or perhaps in America. At all
events I was walking along a dusty highway
in the midst of an inquisitive crowd. In
front of me half-a-dozen members of the
International Police Force (their tunics and
boots gave me to understand their quality)
were dragging along a woman who held a
baby in her arms. A horror-struck and
interested multitude surged behind, and
rested only when the woman was taken
into a large and disgusting edifice with iron
gates. Aided by my distinguished appearance
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 30]</span>
and carriage, I succeeded after some
difficulty in persuading the Chief Gaoler to
let me visit the cell where the mother was
lodged, previous to undergoing an execution
which would doubtless be as unpleasant
as prolonged. I found a robust, apple-cheeked
woman, very clean and neat, despite
her forlorn condition and the rough
handling the guards had used to her. She
confessed to me with tears that she had
been in her day a provincial courtesan, and
that she had been overcome by desire to
have a child, "just to see what it was like."
She had therefore employed all imaginable
shifts to avoid being injected with Smithia,
and had fled with an old admirer to a
lonely cave, where she had brought forth
her child. "And a pretty boy too," she
added, wringing her hands, "and only
fourteen months old."</p>

<p>She was so heartbroken that I did not
like to ask her any more questions till she
had recovered, for fear her answers should
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 31]</span>
be unintelligible. Finally, as I desired to
learn matters that were of common knowledge
to the rest of the world, and was not
anxious to arouse suspicion, I represented
myself as a cultured foreigner who had just
been released from a <i>manicomio</i>, and was
therefore naturally in a state of profound
ignorance on all that appertained to Modern
History. I felt indeed that I would never
have a better chance of gathering information
than from conversation with this solitary
woman. It would be her pleasure, not
her duty, to instruct me.</p>

<p>So I began by asking how the diminishing
numbers of the military could keep a sufficient
watch, and how it was that every one
submitted so meekly to the proclamation.
She answered that the police recruited
themselves yearly from the more active and
noble-minded of the people, that custom
had a lot to do with the submissive attitude
of mankind, and that apart from that,
there was a great resolve abroad to carry
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 32]</span>
out the project of King Harris to fulfilment.
She went on to inform me that Smithia was
tasteless, and would act even when drunk
at meals, and not merely as an injection,
that it acted on both sexes, and that it was
otherwise innocuous. By now most of the
well-springs, reservoirs, and cisterns had
been contaminated by the fluid, of which
large quantities had been prepared at a
very cheap price. After gleaning sundry
other details, I thanked her heartily and
left the cell.</p>

<p>Outside in the courtyard I discovered a
large concourse of people examining the
baby, who was naturally enough an object
of extreme wonder to the whole countryside.
The women called it a duck, and
used other pet names that were not then
in fashion, but most of the men thought it
was an ugly little brat at best. The child
was seated on a cushion, and despite his
mother's absence was crowing vigorously
and kicking with puny force. There was

<h2>THE FLORENTINE LEAGUE</h2>


<p>I feel certain on reflection that the scene
of the last episode must have been America,
for I remember returning to Europe on a
French boat which landed me at Havre,
and immediately taking the train to Paris.
As I passed through Normandy, I saw
hardly a soul stirring in the villages, and the
small houses were all in a most dilapidated
condition. There was no more need for
farms, and villagers in their loneliness were
flocking to the towns. Even the outer
suburbs of Paris were mere masses of
flaked and decaying plaster. An unpleasant
crash into the buffers of Saint Lazare reminded
me that the engine was being driven
by an amateur; indeed, we had met the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 35]</span>
Dieppe train at Rouen, sent a pilot engine
ahead to clear the way, and then raced it
to Paris on the up-line amid enthusiastic
cheers. We won, but were badly shaken.</p>

<p>We left the train beside the platform, trusting
to the Church Missionary Society man
to put it away in the engine-shed. These
excellent philanthropists were unwearying
in their efforts to prevent needless loss of
life, and such work as was still done in the
world was performed almost entirely by
them and by members of kindred British
Protestant societies. They wore a blue
badge to distinguish themselves, and were
ordered about by every one. At the call of
"Anglais, Anglais!" some side-whiskered
man would immediately run up to obey the
summons, and you could send him to get
food from the Store for you, and he would
be only too pleased. They would also cook
hot dinners.</p>

<p>I walked through the Boulevard Montmartre,
and at every step I took I became
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 36]</span>
more profoundly miserable. One had
called Paris the pleasure city, the fairest
city in the world, in the days before the
Proclamation; for one found it vibrating
with beauty and life. And now assuredly
it was supremely a city of pleasure, for
there was no work to be done at all. So
no artist ever took any trouble now, since
there was neither payment nor fame attainable;
and wonderful caricatures of philanthropists
scribbled on the pavement or
elsewhere, or clever ribald songs shrieking
out of gramophones were the only reminder
of that past and beautiful Paris that I had
known. There was a fatuous and brutal
expression on most of the faces, and the
people seemed to be too lazy to do anything
except drink and fondle. Even the
lunatics attracted but little attention. There
was a flying-machine man who was determined,
as he expressed it, "that it should
not be said of the human race that it never
flew." Even the "Anglais" were tired of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 37]</span>
helping him with his machine, which he
was quietly building on the Place de
l'Opéra&mdash;a mass of intricate wires, bamboos,
and paper boxes; and the inventor
himself frequently got lost as he climbed
cheerily among the rigging.</p>

<p>Weary of all this, I slept, alone, in one of
the public beds, and early next morning I
clambered up the sacred slope of the Butte
to see the sunrise. The great silence of
early morning was over the town, a deathly
and unnatural stillness. As I stood leaning
over the parapet, thinking miserably, a
young man came up the hill slowly yet
gracefully, so that it was a pleasure to look
at him. His face was sad and noble, and
as I had never thought to see nobility
again, I hoped he would be a friend to me.
However, he turned himself almost roughly,
and said:</p>

<p>"Why have you come here?"</p>

<p>"To look at the fallen city I loved long
ago," I replied, with careless sorrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 38]</span>
"Have you then also read of the old
times in books?" he said, looking round at
me with large bright eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have read many books," said
I, trying to evade the subject. "But will
you forgive me if I ask an impertinent
question?"</p>

<p>"Nothing coming from you, sir, could
be impertinent."</p>

<p>"I wanted to ask how old you are, because
you seem so young. You seem to
be only seventeen."</p>

<p>"You could tell me nothing more delightful,"
the young man replied, with a
gentle, yet strong and deep intonation. "I
am indeed one of the youngest men alive&mdash;I
am twenty-two years old. And I am looking
for the last time on the city of Paris."</p>

<p>"Do not say that," I cried. "All this
may be horrible, but it cannot be as dull as
Death. Surely there must be some place in
the world where we could live among beauty,
some other folk besides ourselves who are
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 39]</span>
still poets. Why should one die until life
becomes hopelessly ugly and deformed?"</p>

<p>"I am not going to kill myself, as you
seem to think," said the young man. "I
am going, and I pray and implore you to
come with me, to a place after your heart
and mine, that some friends have prepared.
It is a garden, and we are a League. I
have already been there three months, and
I have put on these horrible clothes for
one day only, in obedience to a rule of our
League, that every one should go out once
a year to look at the world around. We
are thinking of abolishing the rule."</p>

<p>"How pleasant and beautiful it sounds!"</p>

<p>"It is, and will you come with me there
right now?"</p>

<p>"Shall I be admitted?"</p>

<p>"My word will admit you at once. Come
this way with me. I have a motor at the
bottom of the hill."</p>

<p>During the journey I gathered much information
about the League, which was
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 40]</span>
called the Florentine League. It had been
formed out of the youngest "years" of the
race, and its members had been chosen for
their taste and elegance. For although few
parents of the day had thought it worth
while to teach their children anything more
recondite than their letters and tables, yet
some of the boys and girls had developed
a great desire for knowledge, and an exceeding
great delight in Poetry, Art, Music,
and all beautiful sights and sounds.</p>

<p>"We live," he said, "apart from the
world, like that merry company of gentle-folk
who, when the plague was raging at
Florence, left the city, and retiring to a
villa in the hills, told each other those
enchanting tales. We enjoy all that Life,
Nature, and Art can give us, and Love has
not deserted the garden, but still draws his
golden bow. It is no crippled and faded
Eros of the city that dwells among us, but
the golden-thighed God himself. For we
do all things with refinement, and not like
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 41]</span>
those outside, seeing to it that in all our
acts we keep our souls and bodies both
delicate and pure."</p>

<p>We came to the door of a long wall, and
knocked. White-robed attendants appeared
in answer to our summons, and I was
stripped, bathed, and anointed by their
deft hands. All the while a sound of singing
and subdued laughter made me eager
to be in the garden. I was then clothed in
a very simple white silk garment with a
gold clasp; the open door let sunshine in
upon the tiles, and my friend, also clothed
in silk, awaited me. We walked out into
the garden, which was especially noticeable
for those flowers which have always been
called old-fashioned&mdash;I mean hollyhocks,
sweet-william, snapdragons, and Canterbury
bells, which were laid out in regular
beds. Everywhere young men and women
were together: some were walking about
idly in the shade; some played at fives;
some were reading to each other in the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 42]</span>
arbours. I was shown a Grecian temple in
which was a library, and dwelling-places
near it. I afterwards asked a girl called
Fiore di Fiamma what books the Florentines
preferred to read, and she told me
that they loved the Poets best, not so much
the serious and strenuous as those whose
vague and fleeting fancies wrap the soul in
an enchanting sorrow.</p>

<p>I asked: "Do you write songs, Fiore di
Fiamma?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have written a few, and music
for them."</p>

<p>"Do sing me one, and I will play the
guitar."</p>

<p>So she sang me one of the most mournful
songs I had ever heard, a song which
had given up all hope of fame, written for
the moment's laughter or for the moment's
tears.</p>

<p>"Wind," I said that night, "stay with me
many years in the garden."</p>

<p>But it was not the Wind I kissed.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPVI" id="CHAPVI"></a>VI</h3>

<h2>OUTSIDE</h2>


<p>I passed many years in that sad, enchanted
place, dreaming at times of my mother's
roses, and of friends that I had known
before, and watching our company grow
older and fewer. There was a rule that no
one should stay there after their thirty-seventh
birthday, and some old comrades
passed weeping from us to join the World
Outside. But most of them chose to take
poison and to die quietly in the Garden;
we used to burn their bodies, singing, and
set out their urns on the grass. In time
I became Prince of the Garden: no one
knew my age, and I grew no older; yet
my Flame-Flower knew when I intended to
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 44]</span>
die. Thus we lived on undisturbed, save
for some horrible shout that rose from time
to time from beyond the walls; but we
were not afraid, as we had cannon mounted
at our gates. At last there were twelve of
us left in the precinct of delight, and we
decided to die all together on the eve of
the Queen's birthday. So we made a great
feast and held good cheer, and had the
poison prepared, and cast lots. The first
lot fell to Fiore di Fiamma, and the last
lot to me; whereat all applauded. I watched
my Queen, who had never seemed to me
as noble as then, in her mature and majestic
beauty. She kissed me, and drank, and the
others drank, became very pale, and fell to
earth. Then I, rising with a last pæan of
exultation, raised the cup to my lips.</p>

<p>But that moment the trees and flowers
bent beneath a furious storm, and the cup
was wrenched out of my hand by a terrific
blast and sent hurtling to the ground. I
saw the rainbow-coloured feathers flashing,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 45]</span>
and for a second I saw the face of the
Wind himself. I trembled, and sinking into
my chair buried my face in my hands. A
wave of despair and loneliness broke over
me. I felt like a drowning man.</p>

<p>"Take me back, Lord of the Wind!" I
cried. "What am I doing among these
dead æsthetes? Take me back to the
country where I was born, to the house
where I am at home, to the things I used
to handle, to the friends with whom I
talked, before man went mad. I am sick
of this generation that cannot strive or
fight, these people of one idea, this doleful,
ageing world. Take me away!"</p>

<p>But the Wind replied in angry tones, not
gently as of old:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is it thus you treat me, you whom I
singled out from men? You have forgotten
me for fifteen years; you have
wandered up and down a garden, oblivious
of all things that I had taught you, incurious,
idle, listless, effeminate. Now I
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 46]</span>
have saved you from dying a mock death,
like a jester in a tragedy; and in time I
will take you back, for that I promised;
but first you shall be punished as you
deserve." So saying, the Wind raised me
aloft and set me beyond the wall.</p>

<p>I dare not describe&mdash;I fear to remember
the unutterable loathing of the three years
I spent outside. The unhappy remnant of
a middle-aged mankind was gradually exchanging
lust for gluttony. Crowds squatted
by day and by night round the Houses of
Dainty Foods that had been stocked by
Harris the King; there was no youthful
face to be found among them, and scarcely
one that was not repulsively deformed with
the signs of lust, cunning, and debauch. At
evening there were incessant fires of crumbling
buildings, and fat women made horrible
attempts at revelry. There seemed to be
no power of thought in these creatures.
The civilisation of ages had fallen from
them like a worthless rag from off their
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 47]</span>
backs. Europeans were as bestial as Hottentots,
and the noblest thing they ever did
was to fight. For sometimes a fierce desire
of battle seized them, and then they tore each
other passionately with teeth and nails.</p>

<p>I cannot understand it even now. Surely
there should have been some Puritans somewhere,
or some Philosophers waiting to die
with dignity and honour. Was it that there
was no work to do? Or that there were
no children to love? Or that there was
nothing young in the World? Or that all
beautiful souls perished in the garden?</p>

<p>I think it must have been the terrible
thought of approaching extinction that obsessed
these distracted men. And perhaps
they were not totally depraved. There was
a rough fellowship among them, a desire to
herd together; and for all that they fought
so much, they fought in groups. They
never troubled to look after the sick and
the wounded, but what could they do?</p>

<p>One day I began to feel that I too was
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 48]</span>
one of them&mdash;I, who had held aloof in
secret ways so long, joined the gruesome
company in their nightly dance, and sat
down to eat and drink their interminable
meal. Suddenly a huge, wild, naked man
appeared in front of the firelight, a prophet,
as it appeared, who prophesied not death
but life. He flung out his lean arms
and shouted at us: "In vain have you
schemed and lingered and died, O Last
Generation of the Damned. For the cities
shall be built again, and the mills shall
grind anew, and the church bells shall ring,
and the Earth be repeopled with new
miseries in God's own time."</p>

<p>I could not bear to hear this fellow speak.
Here was one of the old sort of men, the
men that talked evil, and murmured about
God. "Friends," I said, turning to the
Feasters, "we will have no skeletons like
that at our feast." So saying I seized a
piece of flaming wood from the fire, and
rushed at the man. He struggled fiercely,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 49]</span>
but he had no weapon, and I beat him
about the head till he fell, and death rattled
in his throat&mdash;rattled with what seemed to
me a most familiar sound. I stood aghast;
then wiped the blood from the man's eyes
and looked into them.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" I exclaimed. "I have
seen you before; I seem to know the
sound of your voice and the colour of
your eyes. Can you speak a word and
tell us your story, most unhappy prophet,
before you die?"</p>

<p>"Men of the Last Generation," said the
dying man, raising himself on his elbow&mdash;"Men
of the Last Generation, I am Joshua
Harris, your King."</p>

<p>As brainless frogs who have no thought
or sense in them, yet shrink when they
are touched, and swim when the accustomed
water laves their eager limbs, so
did these poor creatures feel a nerve
stirring within them, and unconsciously
obey the voice which had commanded
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 50]</span>
them of old. As though the mere sound
of his tremulous words conveyed an irresistible
mandate, the whole group came
shuffling nearer. All the while they preserved
a silence that made me afraid, so
reminiscent was it of that deadly hush
that had followed the Proclamation, of
the quiet army starting for London, and
especially of that mysterious and sultry
morning so many years ago when the
roses hung their enamelled heads and the
leaves were as still as leaves of tin or
copper. They sat down in circles round
the fire, maintaining an orderly disposition,
like a stray battalion of some defeated
army which is weary of fruitless journeys
in foreign lands, but still remembers discipline
and answers to command. Meanwhile,
the dying man was gathering with
a noiseless yet visible effort every shred
of strength from his massive limbs, and
preparing to give them his last message.
As he looked round on that frightful
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 51]</span>
crowd great tears, that his own pain and
impending doom could never have drawn
from him, filled his strange eyes.</p>

<p>"Forgive me&mdash;forgive me," he said at
last, clearly enough for all to hear. "If
any of you still know what mercy is, or
the meaning of forgiveness, say a kind
word to me. Loving you, relying on
humanity and myself, despising the march
of Time and the power of Heaven, I became
a false redeemer, and took upon
my back the burden of all sin. But how
was I to know, my people, I who am
only a man, whither my plans for your
redemption would lead? Have none of
you a word to say?</p>

<p>"Is there no one here who remembers
our fighting days? Where are the great
lieutenants who stood at my side and
cheered me with counsel? Where are
Robertson, Baldwin, and Andrew Spencer?
Are there none of the old set left?"</p>

<p>He brushed the tears and blood from his
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 52]</span>
eyes and gazed into the crowd. Pointing
joyously to an old man who sat not far
away he called out, "I know you, Andrew,
from that great scar on your forehead.
Come here, Andrew, and that quickly."</p>

<p>The old man seemed neither to hear nor
understand him, but sat like all the rest,
blinking and unresponsive.</p>

<p>"Andrew," he cried, "you must know
me! Think of Brum and South Melton
Street. Be an Englishman, Andrew&mdash;come
and shake hands!"</p>

<p>The man looked at him with staring, timid
eyes; then shuddered all over, scrambled
up from the ground, and ran away.</p>

<p>"It does not matter," murmured the
King of the World. "There are no men
left. I have lived in the desert, and I
saw there that which I would I had seen
long ago&mdash;visions that came too late to
warn me. For a time my Plan has conquered;
but that greater Plan shall be
victorious in the end."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 53]</span>
I was trying to stanch the wounds I
had inflicted, and I hoped to comfort him,
but he thrust me aside.</p>

<p>"I know that no man of this generation
could have killed me. I have nothing in
common with you, bright Spirit. It was
not you I loved, not for you I fought
and struggled, but for these. I do not
want to be reminded, by that light of
reason shining in your eyes, of what we
were all of us, once. It was a heroic
age, when good and evil lived together,
and misery bound man to man. Yet I
will not regret what I have done. I ask
forgiveness not of God, but of Man; and I
claim the gratitude of thousands who are
unknown, and unknown shall ever remain.
For ages and ages God must reign over an
empty kingdom, since I have brought to an
end one great cycle of centuries. Tell me,
Stranger, was I not great in my day?"</p>

<p>He fell back, and the Wind that took
his Spirit carried me also into space.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPVII" id="CHAPVII"></a>VII</h3>

<h2>THE LAST MEN</h2>


<p>The Wind bore me onwards more than
forty years, and I found seated beside a
granary half-a-dozen wrinkled and very
aged men, whose faces were set with a
determination to go on living to the bitter
end. They were delirious, and naked; they
tore their white beards; they mumbled and
could not speak. The great beasts came
out of the forest by night softly and gazed
at them with their lantern eyes, but never
did them harm. All day long they ate and
slept or wandered a little aimlessly about.
During that year four of them died.</p>

<p>Afterwards I saw the last two men. One
of them was lying on the ground gasping
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 55]</span>
passionately for breath, his withered limbs
awry with pain. I could see that he had
been a magnificent man in his youth. As
his old friend died, the Last of the Race
remembered his Humanity. He bent down,
kissed the livid lips, carefully and tearfully
closed the filmed red eyes. He even tried
to scratch a grave with his long finger-nails,
but soon despaired. He then went
away, plodding as fast as he could hobble,
weeping silently, afraid of the Dead. In
the afternoon he came to a vast city, where
many corpses lay; and about nightfall,
when the stars were shining, he came to
a massive half-ruined Dome that had been
used for the worship of some God. Entering,
he tottered towards the altar, which
still stood, half-buried in stone-dust and
flakes; and reaching up to a great bronze
Crucifix that stood upon it, with his dying
strength he clasped to his arms the Emblem
of our Sorrow.</p>


<hr style='width:40%' />

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 56]</span>
I saw the vast Halls and Palaces of men
falling in slowly, decaying, crumbling, destroyed
by nothing but the rains and the
touch of Time. And looking again I saw
wandering over and above the ruins, moving
curiously about, myriads of brown, hairy,
repulsive little apes.</p>

<p>One of them was building a fire with
sticks.</p>

<p>This volume is a collection of some of the best studies of Mr.
W. R. Titterton, one of the most brilliant journalists of the Modern
School, whose volume "Love Poems" has been one of the successes

<p>"Studies in Solitary Life" is not a collection of stories with plots,

<p>Tramps, beggar-children, ledger-clerks, bohemian town-dwellers
and all lonely people claim the author's sympathy, and his virile pen
presents their surroundings and emotions so powerfully and realistically
that the reader at once feels personally acquainted with the
characters portrayed. When the reader has finished the book, he
will find that he has been listening to a startling indictment and a
triumphal justification of Life.</p>

degenerate.</b> By <span class="smcap">G. Bernard Shaw</span>.</p>

<p>"A scathing indictment of Max Nordau's 'Degeneration.' Mr.
Shaw's book should prove wholesome reading for the section of
cranks who, like Nordau, shower abuse upon everything that departs
from conventional standards."&mdash;<i>The Daily Mail.</i></p>

argument, admirably employed and wielded."&mdash;<i>The Daily Telegraph.</i></p>

itself is not only valuable as a compendium of Shawesque
first principles in philosophy and ethics, but also as a workable

By Dr. <span class="smcap">M. D. Eder</span>.</p>

<p>In this book an analysis is made of the present social conditions
from the medical side.</p>

<p>A consideration that it is desirable to encourage the production
of healthy children, and to repress the breeding of unhealthy
children, leads the author to the conclusion that only by making
mothers free to select their partners and economically independent
of these partners, is any advance possible.</p>

<p>He points out how inadequate is the help which is afforded to
maternity and presents a plan for the State Endowment of Motherhood,
which would, at the same time, not remove the children from
their mother's care. He further gives a summary of all the
measures already undertaken for the purpose of making maternity
easier.</p>
